Lab details
Goal: Setup infrastructure from previous Lab using Terraform (and optionally Ansible)
For a G: Setup infrastructure with Terraform and Openstack Provider
For a VG: Everything from G plus using Cloud-init and/or Ansible to deploy the rest of the software (e.g web server installation and file deployment)
Turn in by: 2023-02-10
What to turn in: Screenshots of your web page open in your browser and compressed archive of all your terraform (and other related files for the environment) so that I could set it up as well. Send to jonas@sarimner.com
Extra challenges for going above and beyond!
- Use Version Control and CI/CD (stuff like Gitlab CI/CD or Github Action) to run when you commit your changes and apply them automatically to the environment
- Setup an existing open source project (ex. Wordpress, Gitea, etc.) start to finish with infrastructure (Terraform) and Cloud-init or Ansible for configuration/application deployment.
- If you want something more exotic, let me know... I'll come up with something more "cruel"!
